**BedrockGUI** is a simple yet powerful plugin that allows server owners to create custom GUI menus for Bedrock players on Java servers via [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/). Using the Floodgate API, this plugin offers seamless interaction for Bedrock players through custom forms and menus.

2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server to generate the default `config.yml` file.
4. Edit the `config.yml` file to define your menus.

## Compiling from Source

If you'd like to build your own version of BedrockGUI, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool.

### Steps to Build

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Build the plugin using Gradle's `shadowJar` task:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew shadowJar
    ```

3. Copy the generated JAR file from the `build/libs/` directory into your server's `plugins` folder.

### Customizing
Modify the source code to add features or change functionality, then re-run the `shadowJar` task to generate an updated JAR.
